# Class 04

## Warmup
- jQuery code that has many bugs :(

## Code Review
- Discussion of Mustache
- Griffin Gallery of Horns!

## Regular Expressions
- What are regular expressions?
- Technology that allows us to encode patterns using a string.
  - Pattern matching, finding specific sub-strings with a string.

```js

'dog'.match('o') // not quite regex

/o/ // our naked regex
```

- see lecture vid for slides

## CSS Grid
- Another Layout Methodology? Yes.
- Grid is quite powerful, relatively fun to implement.
  - Still uses double axes, (rows, and columns);
  - Give more flexiblity to the chilren.
  - Really wants you to think of your grid, similar to the HTML `table` elements
